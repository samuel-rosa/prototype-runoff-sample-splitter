__ABSTRACT__

The method used to obtain runoff samples in soil erosion monitoring studies is an important source of data 
variability. In this study, we evaluated the manual sampling method used in Brazil. We present as an
alternative the prototype of a sample splitter for suspensions with high concentration of total solids. Using
soil material with 583 g kg^-1^ of sand and 89 g kg^-1^ of clay, the manual method and the sample splitter were
tested for their ability to produce representative samples of suspensions with a concentration of 2, 10 and 50
g L ^-1^ of total solids. An underestimation of 30% or more of the concentration of total solids was observed
using the manual method, with a variation of the same magnitude (CV between 20 and 45%). The splitter was
efficient in producing samples representative of the suspension -- even without altering the particle size
distribution of the total solids. Both absolute percentage errors (|<5%|) and the variation between replicates
(CV <3%) were small. The problems with the manual method are due to the inefficient homogenization that
facilitates the differential sedimentation of the particles of different sizes. If these problems are also
found in other studies, then the prototype that we developed is a reasonable alternative.
